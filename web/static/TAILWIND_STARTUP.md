# Storing tailwind

```powershell
npx tailwindcss -i .\static\global.css -o .\static\main.css --watch
```

## What's this for?
The website uses [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to generate CSS really easily. The above command stores
it as main.css which is already linked in the template files.
